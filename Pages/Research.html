                  <h3>Inferring Lunar Volcanic Gas Cloud Evolution from Nano-Analysis of Glass Bead Surface Sublimates</h3>

                  <p>Analysis of lunar glass beads demonstrates that at least part of the lunar mantle retains significant volatile contents [Saal et al. (2008), Hauri et al. (2015)].
                  These beads were most likely formed in fire-fountaining volcanic eruptions, a process in which the majority of the volatile contents within their parent melts were depleted.
                  Despite this loss, a fraction of the volatile elements de-sublimated out of the volcanic gas clouds, forming thin (20-100 nm) coatings around the beads.</p> 

                  <p> Recent models demonstrate that there is a correlation between these condensed coatings and the chemical composition and physical conditions - 
                  namely pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacity - of the volcanic gases from which they originate [Renggli et al. (2017), Zolotov and Liu, (2021), Liu & Ma, (2022)]. 
                  This relationship implies that the petrology, geochemistry, and stratigraphy of these coatings can provide insights into the composition and evolution of 
                  gases emitted by lunar volcanoes. Consequently, these findings hold the potential to increase our understanding of lunar volatiles. </p> 

                  <p>To this end, I am using a comprehensive suite of nanoanalytical techniques including Nanoscale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy, 
                    Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy, and Atom Probe Tomography to investigate 
                 the mineralogy and stratigraphy of sublimate coatings on pristine glass beads that have never been exposed to air. This information is coupled with thermodynamic 
                 modelling, with the primary goal of reconstructing the pressure, temperature, and compositional evolution of the lost lunar volcanic gas cloud.</p>

                  <h3>Non-Equilibrium Degassing of Noble Gases in Magmas</h3>

                  <p>High <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He ratios in Ocean Island Basalts (OIBs) are viewed as evidence for sampling of
                  an undegassed primitive mantle source by mantle plumes. However, this does not explain why helium
                  concentrations and the elemental ratios He/Ar and He/Ne in OIBs are an order of magnitude lower than in Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts
                  (MORBs). This discrepancy, often referred to as the 'Helium Paradox', challenges our understanding of mantle degassing processes.
                  Various studies invoke disequilibrium degassing as the solution to this problem [Gonnermann and Mukhopadhyay (2007), Weston (2015)]. 
                  However, there is significant disagreement between current models. </p>

                  <p>In response to these unresolved questions, we are developing a new model that more accurately reflects the behavior of 
                  gas bubbles during the degassing of noble gases. We employ a lattice Boltzmann method for free surface flows, 
                  based on the approach of KÃ¶rner et al. (2005). This method is particularly suited for our purposes as it can simulate the solubility-pressure 
                  relationships of CO<sub>2</sub> and noble gases, account for hydrodynamic interactions between bubbles, and, importantly, model the nucleation of new bubbles 
                  driven by volatile supersaturation.</p>

                  <p>Such nucleation events are critical during the ascent of magma, as they can counteract kinetic fractionation by reducing the diffusional 
                  length scale. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first degassing model to incorporate the nucleation of new bubbles with realistic physics, 
                  Through this work, we aim to offer a more comprehensive framework for interpreting noble gas signatures 
                  in MORBs and OIBs, thereby addressing a key aspect of the Helium Paradox. </p>
