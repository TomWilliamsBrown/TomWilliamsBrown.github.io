                  <p>Lunar pyroclastic glass beads preserve a record of physical and chemical conditions within volcanic gas clouds inthe form of nanoscale minerals vapour-deposited onto 
                  their surfaces. However, the scale of these mineral deposits - less than 100 nm - has presented challenges for detailed analysis. Using SEM, TEM, APT, and NanoSIMS, we 
                  analysed pristine black glass beads from Apollo drive tube 74001 and found a sequence of sulfide depositionthat directly evidences lunar gas cloud evolution. 
                  The deposits are predominantly micromound structures ofnanopolycrystalline sphalerite ((Zn,Fe)S), with iron enrichment at the bead-micromound interface. 
                  Thermo-chemical modelling indicates that hydrogen and sulfur were major elements within the volcanic plume and tiesthe iron gradient to decreasing gas pressure during deposition. 
                  This pressure drop may also be consistent withour observed trend of potential δ34 S depletion. Finally, Apollo 17 74220 orange beads, deposited higher in the Shorty Crater sequence,
                  appear to lack abundant ZnS nanocrystals (Liu and Ma, 2024a), suggesting a change invapour deposition between orange- and black-glass bead deposition. Together, our 
                  results suggest a change ineruption style over the course of a pyroclastic volcanic eruption in the Taurus-Littrow Valley.</p>

                  <h3>Non-Equilibrium Degassing of Noble Gases in Magmas</h3>

                  <p>High <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He ratios in Ocean Island Basalts (OIBs) are viewed as evidence for sampling of
                  an undegassed primitive mantle source by mantle plumes. However, this does not explain why helium
                  concentrations and the elemental ratios He/Ar and He/Ne in OIBs are an order of magnitude lower than in Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalts
                  (MORBs). This discrepancy, often referred to as the 'Helium Paradox', challenges our understanding of mantle degassing processes.
                  Various studies invoke disequilibrium degassing as the solution to this problem [Gonnermann and Mukhopadhyay (2007), Weston (2015)]. 
                  However, there is significant disagreement between current models. </p>

                  <p>In response to these unresolved questions, we are developing a new model that more accurately reflects the behavior of 
                  gas bubbles during the degassing of noble gases. We employ a lattice Boltzmann method for free surface flows, 
                  based on the approach of Körner et al. (2005). This method is particularly suited for our purposes as it can simulate the solubility-pressure 
                  relationships of CO<sub>2</sub> and noble gases, account for hydrodynamic interactions between bubbles, and, importantly, model the nucleation of new bubbles 
                  driven by volatile supersaturation.</p>

                  <p>Such nucleation events are critical during the ascent of magma, as they can counteract kinetic fractionation by reducing the diffusional 
                  length scale. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first degassing model to incorporate the nucleation of new bubbles with realistic physics, 
                  Through this work, we aim to offer a more comprehensive framework for interpreting noble gas signatures 
                  in MORBs and OIBs, thereby addressing a key aspect of the Helium Paradox. </p>
